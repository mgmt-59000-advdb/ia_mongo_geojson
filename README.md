# Mongo GeoJSON Queries

You will need to create a new database named `pune` in your MongoDB cluster.

Then, upload two collections to your database for this assessment. Instructions are included in the playgroud file.
* [Wards](pune_wards.json)
* [Restaurants](pune_restaurants.json)

Open Visual Studio Code and create a connection to your MongoDB cluster.

Copy the contents of the [mongo_pune_geojson.mongodb.js](mongo_pune_geojson.mongodb.js) file into your local playground file in Visual Studio Code and save it to your local computer.

Edit the file as needed to answer the included questions.

You'll submit your entire playground file as your submission for this assessment.
